### Lab 2
#### Abstract
React is a view / DOM manipulation library only, unlike other, more fully-featured, JS frameworks.  It is common to use other libraries from NPM when working in React.  Try loading `moment.js` here.

#### Hints
- Navigate to the root: `cd ..`
- Install the package: `npm install --save moment`
- Switch to the correct lab: `cd Lab2`
- Start the dev server: `npm start`
- Import moment just like `React` and `ReactDOM` are imported
- Use Moment to format the date!
- Documentation: `http://momentjs.com`
