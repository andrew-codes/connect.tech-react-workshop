### Lab 12
#### Abstract
Testing views is hard, but in React, its manageable.  Using the virtual DOM, sometimes you don't have to render to the DOM at all. Using pure functional components, its even easier: Give it an input, analyze the virtual DOM - no mocking required.

#### Hints
- `npm install chai enzyme react-addons-test-utils chai-enzyme --save-dev`
