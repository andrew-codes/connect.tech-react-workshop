#### Abstract
Animations are a common tool to help your application's user follow rich interactions

- Go into `styles.css` and figure out and play with code to do fix animation
- Apply a 3D CSS3 animation, reference: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transforms/Using_CSS_transforms`
