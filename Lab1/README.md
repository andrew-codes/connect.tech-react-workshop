### Lab 1
#### Abstract
Show the current date and time on the page.  This lab is meant to teach you the practice of escaping JSX, using a basic React Component, and running the dev server.

#### Hints
- Navigate to the directory: `cd Lab1`
- Start the dev server: `npm start`
- Use curly braces to escape the JSX and write pure JS, such as a variable: `{dateVar}`
- As you edit `app.js`, watch it auto-reload!
